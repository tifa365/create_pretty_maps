    "\n",
    "In this script, we will take a look at the features and functionalities of the [prettymaps](https://github.com/marceloprates/prettymaps) library by marceloprates. In short, the library is used to visually colorize [Open Street Map data](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). The geographic base data is downloaded from Open Street Map and then the properties of this data are individually adjusted, colored, and finally saved as an image (a map).\n",
    "\n",
    "Prettymaps provides a pretty extensive introduction script with explanations of how to start your map making process. Start with this script and see if you can run the code, either in your Google Colab or locally (rather not recommended). After that you can use both this explanation and the official tutorial to build more complicated maps.\n",

    "Maps can be created even without extensive programming knowledge. I have tried to make it clear which two lines of code need to be adjusted in order to quickly create your own maps. The map script uses the Python programming language. Open Street Maps is used as the tool to obtain the data for the map. The more one knows about both, the easier it is to customize the map individually. For a deeper understanding of the code, it is worth looking at the Python data structure [dictionary](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) and the structure of [functions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions). Open Street Map works with [keys and values](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features) regarding geo-objects. It is also worth reading into that. However, this knowledge is not absolutely necessary, as mentioned.\n"
