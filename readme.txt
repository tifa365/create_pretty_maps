To code along, you will need a Github account and familiarize yourself shortly with Github Codespaces. Codespaces allow you to "clone" a whole Github environment online without the hassle of installing it locally, package incompatibilities, etc.

1. Open my presentation https://bitly.ws/ZVCY or use link from the workshop descriptions 
2. Create a Github account if you do not own one yet https://github.com/signup
3. Open https://github.com/tifa365/create_pretty_maps
4. Follow video instructions https://bitly.ws/ZVDf
5. Donâ€™t worry, the Codespace will take a while to load when installing
6. Try to run the code
7. You can also clone the repo and run your own virtual environment locally but I would not recommend
8. If you are working with R, open the training_script_R and try to run the script

We will mostly be working with the first two scripts in the "training_scripts" folder. The third is optional and dives deep into using the prettymaps-package which you have to run in a separate Google Colab script or your own virtual environment.
